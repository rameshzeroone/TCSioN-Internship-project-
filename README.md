** Classification Model - Build a Model that Classifies the Side Effects of a Drug**
 
 A side effect is an unwanted symptom caused by medical treatment. All medicines can cause side effects, including prescription, over-the-counter and complementary medicines. Complementary medicines include herbal preparations, vitamins, and some products dispensed by naturopaths and other practitioners of complementary medicine. 

Here in this internship I need to create a dataset of 4 lakh patients with details such as names,age,gender,race,side effects. First, we will perform preprocessing on the data then performing classification algorithms on this data. Feature engineering, feature selection and classification model will be selected.

OBJECTIVE:

Side effects and Effectiveness of a particular drug need to be addressed. The objective of this project is to build a classification model that classifies the side effects of a particular drug by age, gender and race

Dataset Description:

Name : It contains the names of different patients whose datas are collected.
Age: It is a range column.It contains the range of age group within  which the patient belongs.
Condition:It is a categorical column which contains the various conditions of patients or symptoms.
Date:It is a date column which contains the date on which a patient taken that drug.
Drug:It is a categorical column which contains the name of various drugs patients are taking.
Drug Id:It is a unique value for each Drug.
Ease of Use:It is a kind of rating given to each drug based on its easiness in using.
Effectiveness:It is also a kind of rating for side effects of a particular drug.
Reviews:These are categorical columns .It contains the reviews of different patients on having particular drug.
Satisfaction:It is also a rating provided by patients when they are satisfied with the drug they used.
Sides:These are categorical column which contain all the side effects of drugs.
Useful count:These shows the usefulness of drug as a ranking.
Sex:These are gender of various patients.It contains male and female.

Conclusion:

In the dataset I have done all the necessary pre-processing steps. Then I have made some useful visualizations out of it. After that Classification of side effects of a drug called ‘Cymbalta’ is done.
The Side effect of the drug is best modelled by Gradient Boosting without doing any scaling and standardization. People in the age group 45-54 mostly used this drug and within that the male ratio was higher. People with the condition 'Major Depressive Disorder' consumed this drug more. Over all by comparing with race also, the male ratio is higher.
